# Browser Console

Open de browser console in Chrome (or another browser).

With ```clear()``` the console will be visually cleaned (so text appears on the top again), but all variables will still be assigned. So to clean properly, refresh the page.

## Types

### String

```typeof 'hello'```

```typeof "hello"```

50% of the world uses single quotes, 50% double quotes. Use what you like, but be consistent.

There is no Char type like in Java or C#.

### Number

```typeof 123```

```typeof 34.56```

There is no distinction between integers and floats.

### Boolean

```typeof true```

### Undefined

```typeof undefined```

### Null

```typeof null```

There is a value assigned, but the value is null.

## Expressions

* Number: ```1 + 2```
* String: ```'a' + 'b'```
* Mixed: ```'a' + 1```

## Equality

### value (only)

```'1' == 1```

### value and identity

```'1' === 1```
```1 === 1```
