We're going to change a website into something that is shown in solution.png 

In the Start folder is the initial situation you need to modify.

In the Solution folder is the final situation that fixes all TODOs.
Use this as a last resort. Use the slides of Appendix A and B or Google "mdn ..." first.

In the Start folder there are a number of TODOs for you to fix:
1 TODO in index.html
5 TODOs in styles.css
2 TODOs in student.js

Good luck!
