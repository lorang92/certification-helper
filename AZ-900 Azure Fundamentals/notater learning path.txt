Containers
	=> consistant isolated execution environment for
	applications. Multiple can reside on single machine. Abtstracts away OS.
	
Serverless Computing
	=> lets you run application code without creating,
	configuring or maintaining a server. Focus on how
	the application behaves.
	
Benefits of cloud computing
	- Cost Effective
		- pay as you go
		- consumption-based model
			- no upfront cost
			- no need to manage costly infrastructure

	- Scalable
		- Vertical scaling
			=> adding resources to increase power of an 
			existing server.
				- faster cpu
				- additional cpus
				- more memory
		- Horizontal Scaling
			=> adding more servers that function together
				- can be done manually and auto
	- Elastic
		=> can adjust resources based on load
	
	- Reliable
		- high uptime
		
	- Global
		=> fully redundant
	
	- Secure

Compliance terms and requirements

	- CJIS - security policy
	- CSA Star Certification
	- GDPR
Exists several. Microsoft is doin well.

Economies of scale
	=> the ability to do things more efficiently at
	lower cost per unit when operating at a larger
	scale. 

Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
	=> the spending of money on physical infrastructure
	up front, and then deducting that expense from 
	your tax bill over time. Upfront cost, value
	decreases over time.
	
Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
	=> spending money on services or products now
	being billed fror them now. You can deduct
	this expense from your tax bill in the same year.
	No upfront cost, you pas as you use it.
	
OpEx is particularry appealing if demand fluctuates
or is unknown because cloud computing is agile.

Cloud Deployment Models

	Public
	=> No local hardware. Everything runs on providers
	hardware.
		- Pros
			- high scalability/agility
			- pay as you go pricing
			- not responsible for maintaining
			- minimal technical knowhow
		- Cons:
			- specific security requirements that
			can not be met by using a public cloud
			- govement policies, industry standards,
			legal requirements which public clouds
			can not meet
			- You dont own hardware or services and 
			cant manage them as you may wish
			- legacy systems might be hard to maintain

	Private
	=> create cloud environment in your own datacenter
	and provide self-service access to compute resources
	to users in your organization. Simulation of public
	cloud to your users, but you remain completely
	responsible for the purchase and maintanance of the
	hardware and software you provide.
		- Pros:
			- Complete control over resources and can
			ensure config can support any scenario
			- Complete control over security
			- Can meet strict restrictions (legal, sec)
		- Cons:
			- Upfront CapEx costs
			- Owning equipment limits agility
			- Requires IT skills and expertise
	Use case: org has data it can not put in public cloud
	
	Hybrid
	=> combines public and private 
		- allows you to run applications in the most
		appropriate location.
	- Host website in the public cloud and link to a
	highly secure database hosted privatly
		- Pros:
			- Keep any systems running and accessable
			that has outdated soft- or hard-ware.
			- Flexibiliy vs private
			- Take adventage of economies of scale
		- Cons: it can be more expensive then selecting
		one deployment model since it involves
		some capEx cost up front
		- complicated
		
Types of cloud services
	
	IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
		=> Most flexible. Complete control over hardware.
		Instead of buing hardware, you rent it.
		Shared responsibility for uptime.
		Commonly used for:
			- Migrating workloads
			- Test and development
			- Website hosting
			- Storage, backup, and recovery
			
	PaaS - Platform as a service
		=> Provides environment for building, testing and
		deploying software applications. 
		Goal is to help you create an app quickly, without
		managing the underlying infrastructure.
		No need to install operating system, web server or
		even system updates.
		Commonly used for:
			- Development framework
			- Analytics or business intelligence

Availiability Zone => physically seperate datacenters
designed to be an isolation boundary, if one goes down
the other stays up. Not alle regions supports this.

Zonal services => you pin the resource to a specific
zone
Zone-redundant services => platform replicates auto
accross zones

Availiablity zones are greated using two datacenters
within a single regions

Region Pair => each azure region is always paired
with another region within the same geography at least
300 miles away.
	
Resiliency => ability of a system to recover from
failures and continiue to funciton.

Paid Azure Support Plans
	Developer
	Standard
	Professional Direct
	Premier
	
Enterprise can buy standard, professional, and premier
while developer can buy developer.

Storage Tiers
	- Hot storage tier: frequently
	- Cool storage tier: infrequently, and stored for
	atleast 30 days
	- Achive Storage tier: rarely accessed, and stored
	atleast 180 days

Azure Blueprints => predefined to adhere to 
compoany standards, patterns and requirements

Compliance Manager => enables you to track and verify
the orgz regulatory compliance

Azure Monitor => maximizes the availiability and
performance of your applications by delivering a 
comprehensive solution for collection, analyzing
and acting on telemetry 
Can log app, os, platform
		
Application Insights, Azure Monitor for Containers and VMs

Azure Policy 
 => service to create, assign and manage policies
 apply and enforce rules that your resources
 need to follow!

RBAC => fine-grained access management for Azure Resource

Resource locks => protect resources, can set 
to either Delete or Read-only.
Can be applied to resource groups, subscriptions, and
individual resources.

Applying read only can have unexpected results

Locks applies regardles of RBAC-permissions!!!

Factors affecting costs:
	- Resource type
	- Services - differ between enterprise, web direct etc
	- Location
